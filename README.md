## ER Diagram:
An ER model is a design or blueprint of a database that can later be implemented as a database. An ER diagram shows the relationships of entity sets stored in a database. The main components of E-R model are: entity set and relationship set.
## Best Practices of ER Diagram:
- Think hard about the best ways to diagram information for your specific business
- Remove vague, redundant or unnecessary relationships between entities.
- Provide a precise and appropriate name for each entity, attribute, and relationship in the diagram. Terms that are simple and familiar always beats vague, technical-sounding words. 
- In naming entities, remember to use singular nouns. However, adjectives may be used to distinguish entities belonging to the same class (part-time employee and full-time employee, for example). Meanwhile attribute names must be meaningful, unique, system-independent, and easily understandable.
- Never connect a relationship to another relationship.
- Make effective use of colors. You can use colors to classify similar entities or to highlight key areas in your diagrams.
- Avoid Overlapping References
- When ER diagrams get very large and complex, there are usually some tables that are more frequently referenced than others. A solution for this problems is creating shortcut tables. These tables are references (or aliases) to the original table, but they can be placed anywhere. This enables easy referencing without compromising the diagramâ€™s readability and navigability.
